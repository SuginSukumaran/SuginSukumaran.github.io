"""
This package contains machine learning models for classification and regression.

Modules:
--------
- base: Contains the BaseModel class for shared functionalities like hyperparameter validation.
- random_forest: Implements Random Forest for both classification and regression.
- catboost_model: Implements CatBoost for classification and regression.
- ann: Implements Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification.
- xgboost_model: Implements XGBoost for regression.
- ai_pipeline: Manages model selection, training, and evaluation for AI tasks.
